I have an account on Hostinger.

I had a big problem with Laravel File Manager, but now I know what was the problem :)

It`s was an issue with a link to storage. My folder public_html had no link but the copy of storage!

Delete this storage or rename it if you want backup :)

Log in to ssh and use command pwd to get the current folder that will help you build a full path.

Use this command:

ln -s <target_path> <link_path>

In my case this was like:

ln -s /home/u16345434/domains/website.name/storage/app/public /home/u16345434/domains/website.name/public_html/storage

Good Luck :)
